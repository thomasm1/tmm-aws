                        A Return to the Question of Guns, Germs, and Steel: Part II and the Germs
                      </h6>
                      <p class="firstparagraph">Continuing from the commentaries in my last post, the Germs present a timely topic for today, given
                        the especially virulent
                        <strong>Flu Virus strain</strong> this past year
                        <sup>1</sup>. Many, like me, have wondered why our 1940's-era technology in Flu Vaccine fabrication wouldn't
                        invite more innovative solutions. Without feigning any medical expertise, I have to still ask about
                        the mimicry of the ever-mutating--i.e., drifting--Flu virus "head." This strategy "guesses right"
                        very effectively, and provides an effective solution for most, in most years. Yet this winter has
                        revealed that effectiveness statistics are
                        <i>not always</i> in our favor.</p>
                      <p>First a quick word on the Flu's drift, also called "Antigenic Drift," which is the continuous, generational
                        genetic mutations. Above I casually mentioned "guessing", yet with great respect, the huge science
                        behind estimating the flu virus between the time of R &amp; D, fabrication, and the long flu
                        <i>season</i>. (This antigenic drift, not to be confused with
                        <i>Antigenic Shift</i> in which the Flu Virus makes an abrupt change.) I'll let the CDC abbreviate this:</p>
                      <p class="quote">
                        One way they change is called “antigenic drift.” These are small changes in the genes of influenza viruses that happen continually
                        over time as the virus replicates. These small genetic changes usually produce viruses that are pretty
                        closely related to one another, which can be illustrated by their location close together on a phylogenetic
                        tree. Viruses that are closely related to each other usually share the same antigenic properties
                        and an immune system exposed to an similar virus will usually recognize it and respond
                        <sup>2</sup>.
                      </p>
                      <p>So, ultimately, the strategy is to estimate the form, location, of that virus--what it will look like--at
                        a particular period each year. This implicates a strategy to estimate the trajectory, stage by stage,
                        of this virus, i.e. a longitudinal time-series morphology, each year. The article makes this point
                        more precise: </p>
                      <p class="quote">
                        But these small genetic changes can accumulate over time and result in viruses that are antigenically different (further
                        away on the phylogenetic tree). When this happens, the body’s immune system may not recognize those
                        viruses
                        <sup>2</sup>.
                      </p>
                      <p>Petri dishes aside, let's focus on the changing nature of the Flu Virus, which makes itself a
                        <i>research </i>challenge in itself because of an ever-mutating object of study. Yet, this ever-changing
                        nature also provides the very tool Statisticians need most for estimating: Big Data. The Law of Large
                        Numbers means that plain math can accurately plot, and in most cases predict with a moderate statistical
                        significance, future events, sort of.</p>
                      <p>Sort of I say because too often we predict that two separate events are more likely to occur, conditional
                        on each other, then conditional upon other factors. This being
                        <i>correlation</i>, but the Statistician's Holy Grail is the other kind: Causality. Causality hinges
                        on only thre3e things: 1) Association, 2) Time Precedence, and 3) Ruling out any
                        <i> effect</i> of spurious variables. (Hang with me, I'm still getting back to the subject of our annual
                        predictions about a few months' worth of antigenic drift.)
                      </p>
                      <p>Therefore, Big data, and new advances in the statistical sciences, and the technology that increasingly
                        defines our sciences, may soon refine and supercharge research into the first and third of the three
                        points of causality. The first of these, the associations, along the phylogenic tree, are merely
                        a network at its base, the science of which gains computational strength each year. Rare as it is
                        in Academia, in this case Might makes Right!</p>
                      </p>
                      The third tenet of causality, after association and time direction, is ruling out the effect of other factors when separating
                      <i>cause</i> and
                      <i>consequence</i>. Advances in managing big data, and statistical analysis of it, means gaining a better
                      handle on the
                      <i>The Law of Large Numbers</i>
                      <sup>3</sup>, which informs the morphology of the
                      <i>path</i> of the virus, along the phylogenic tree itself, as it appears year after year. Who knows where
                      a cure may come from, perhaps a bio-statistician out there, churning the numbers, may be the one to
                      stumble upon a better Flu Vaccine!

                      <p class="firstparagraph">
                        Back in 1997, a Pulitzer-Prize winning theory--based on Dr. Jared Diamond's
                        <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies</i>
                        <sup id="steel"></sup>--provided the recipe book for the success of societies. Not without controversy, the theory
                        posits that geographic and environmental preconditions, once met, provide tech &amp; resources trading
                        opportunities, within a network of other nation-states also vying for technogical innovation. </p>
                      <p>A nation's Technology, in turn, opens the means necessary to expansive, stable, independent sovereignty
                        that lasts and thrives. Equally so, the nation's friends, especially those making the best-friends
                        list, share and receive a secondary, "residual" technological bump over the time-course of the network's
                        future trading, i.e. network transactions. So, if our best friends Canada and Mexico are less keen,
                        then there is network reverberation!</p>
                      <p>Given the advent of a real, lasting Trade-War, I would think that a network theorist wouldn't be betting
                        on one particular node within this network. I say this because a disproportionately asymmetrical
                        flow of technology and resources, while simultaneously raising prices on most staple goods, may spell
                        trouble for the Every-Day person. So far, Nation-State: 0, People: 0 ... So, who wins with a Trade
                        War? Alas, let's hope not the resurrection of the Neo-Multinational Corporations, also, coincidentally,
                        from the late 1990's. Bah humbug! </p>

                        to mine for Monero
                        <sup>1</sup>.

                        The larger issue here is that the lines between trusted mobile-app authorities, i.e., certified by Play Store or Apple's
                        is increasingly irrelevent. This is because an increasing number of app-users are ditching device-downloaded
                        apps, preferring for browser applications--hence, a much more appetizing market for the newest generation
                        of blackhat hackers, online thieves, peeping-toms, and other ill-wishers. There are a few driving
                        factors for this issue--one of which is the onset of Decentralized Applications (DAPPs), which use
                        the
                        <i>browser</i> to interface between the Every-Day blockchain client/merchant/programmer and the actual
                        byte-code of the blockchain (via WEB).
                        <p>More importantly, the larger issue is that we live in an age in which the exclusive, native browser
                          language since 1995, i.e. JavaScript. Security issues with browser-based apps were very low, because
                          JavaScript never left the browser, ever. Until 2009, Data, Servers were the domain of PHP, JAVA,
                          Python, etc. or some other language for the highly sensitive, dirty work of dipping into all that
                          data sitting ontop of centralized servers around the world. PHP wasn't easy, so power and responsibility
                          usually followed with all the extra effort and expertise.
                          <p>2015 augured in the Node.js server-accessing (can create, read, update, and delete date) new-born

                        Blockchain Sustainability Issues and The Double-Edged Sword
                      </h6>


                      <p class="firstparagraph">
                        I couldn't help but revisit the
                        <strong>Environmental Sustainability</strong> problem I addressed in my February 28th post. This problem,
                        experienced by the top two crypto-currencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, is that the
                        <i>monetary</i> value of the currency is matched to the
                        <i>computing difficulty</i>--measured either by how much the computer is sweating, or by electricity
                        KiloWatt Hours per year
                        <sup>1</sup>. Digiconomist succinctly writes:
                      </p>

                      <p class="quote">The continuous block mining cycle incentivizes people all over the world to mine Bitcoin. As mining
                        can provide a solid stream of revenue, people are very willing to run power-hungry machines to get
                        a piece of it. Over the years this has caused the total energy consumption of the Bitcoin network
                        to grow to epic proportions, as the price of the currency reached new highs
                        <sup>2</sup>. </p>


                      <p>
                        And, so the issue I'm addressing is a side-effect of the deepening incentivization for miners to invest more equipment, and
                        in turn, more electricity. The article goes on to report Bitcoin's surpassing 50 TeraWatt-Hours-per-year
                        usage has surpassed that of Portugal and Singapore, which are 49.5 TWh per year, and 49.8 TWh per
                        year, respectively. In other words, the usage by the Bitcoin miner's cost (in electricity) compared
                        with the miner's gain (in Bitcoins accrued by incentivized mining) drives up and incentives a deeper
                        Carbon Footprint.
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p class="quote">Fueled by a meteoric rise in the Bitcoin price over the past few months, the power usage of the Bitcoin
                          network has been increasing at a feverish pace. Just a little over three months ago, at the start
                          of November 2017, the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index was estimating the total electricity consumption
                          of the Bitcoin network to be half of the current amount. On the first day of November, the estimated
                          consumption was equal to 24.3 TWh per year
                          <sup>1</sup>.

                        </p>
                      </p>Carbon Footprint, measured in this way, equates as a double-edged sword: The miner's electricity costs
                      account for approximately 65% of the profit (Bitcoin units' value, measured when mined). So the
                      <i>economic </i>usage means the cheapest available fuel is part of the business model--and it would lead
                      to the cost of the cheapest source of energy: Dirty Coal. At the end of the day, if the
                      <i>currency's </i>rising value means that more computationally-intensive mining is more and more profitable,
                      then perhaps the other edge looks preferred!</p>

                        Feb 10, 2018</h6>







                      <h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Why are Sociologists now the Key Players in Data Analysis within the Domain of Blockchain Technologies?</h6>















                      <p class="firstparagraph">First, let me describe that blockchain technologies, i.e. Government contracts, Business contracts,
                        Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, all rely on network graph theory, both on the low-level programming
                        technology (peer-to-peer global ip networks) across the spectrum to high-level interfaces for institutional,
                        corporate, individual needs and uses. These blockchain "network" analyses depend on highly variable--and
                        simultaneous--network changes, node changes, and link changes; and, the latter three may arbitrarily
                        change interdependantly or not. </p>



                      <p>Therefore, blockchain technologies must first accomodate complex node variables for contracts (relationships)
                        that include arbitrarily hierarchical mappings and conditional data structures. Secondly, blockchain
                        tech must face analytical challenges that arise from informal practices
                        <sup>1</sup>, by which the organizational nodes (employees) choose to deviate from the employee role's
                        protocol for the sake of efficiency, convenience, company culture, and multiple other levels of human
                        factors.</p>















                      <p> Sociologists Meyer &amp; Rowan's (1977)
                        <i>New Institutionalism</i> explains how employees change practices and decouple
                        <i>actual</i> organizational structure from recorded rules, as a function of organizational size, time,
                        convenience, etc. These continually new, unknown constraints on data must be intimately understood,
                        non-algorithm human understanding
                        <i>by at least one side </i>of the exchange. How do we recognize unwritten, soft rules and behaviors
                        of a bank, a person, or a company's internal bot? </p>



                      <p>The hard sciences domain of Software Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics have brilliantly
                        brought the world the blockchain tool, for which the Hard Sciences can only contribute little on
                        how to interface with social needs. Ask yourself, how well do 1,000 top blockchain-related programmers
                        understand the multi-dimensional layers of hierarchical social, corporate, and governmental relationship
                        networks? Well enough to differentiate qualitative meaning in the smart-contract? Fearfully, no.















                      </p>







                      <p>In the past, the layers of abstraction from raw technological tool to societal use was refined, improved,
                        integrated through multiple layers of "middlemen", such as lawyers, corporate lawyers, government
                        institutions, non-governmental, non-profit and for-profit actors. Blockchain technology, by its very
                        nature, erases the middlemen. Suddenly, one programmer, for example, is writing the same healthcare
                        insurance crypto-contract, that last month an entire team of hospital employees spent a month writing;
                        then overseeing and managing different facets of this same thing. </p>



                      <p>However, the crypto-contract, once deployed to the blockchain, auto-manages the rest, forever or for
                        the life of the contract. Therefore, rather than redoing the trials and errors of 200 years' Sociology
                        Network Analysts' research and analytical development. Therefore, medical and other social fields
                        cannot and should not turn to the Hard Sciences for solutions. These Med researchers and developers
                        are already at home, safe within the academic domain of the Raw Sciences of Medical Sociology, Public
                        Health, and so on. The next ten years of blockchain technology can either be defined by unwitting,
                        piecemeal advances, accompanied by frequent, non-improving distastrous crises. Or, the next ten years
                        can follow Sociology's Scientific Method toward a mildly turbulent, but stable and beautiful future.
                        </p>







                      <p>















                        Examples aside, the primacy of the Sociology academic field in the early 21st century quickly becomes apparent on review
                        of the Sociologists' specialization in network theories imbued with symmetrical and asymmetrical
                        relationships, within social networks that change arbitrarily the direction, conditions, and values
                        of those same relationships. We Sociologists deal with real-time, logical and hierarchical network
                        mappings that appear arbitrary, yet are characterized by fixed patterns. </p>



                      <p>No other academic field than sociology has advanced into the details, and endless network rabbit-holes
                        that characterize societal behavior. Not until this second millenial decade could the marriage of
                        Large Number Statistical Theory become consumated with the brilliance of early 1900's Sociological
                        French Network Theories, like Maurice Halbswach's work on the clearly defined network patterns of
                        a society's Collective Memory.
                      </p>







                      <p>







                        No other academic field has collected and refined knowledge on network arbitrariness, such that Economic's "irrational behaviors"
                        and Mathematical "complexity models" do not
                        <i>touch to the bone</i> the meaning, the intersectionality of network analysis, which must incorporate
                        simultaneous node changes (person gets job /or/ does not get job), network changes (All get jobs
                        /or/ only 3 of 15 network groups get jobs), and most importantly the
                        <i>relationship</i> changes (all jobs always useful /or/ half of job groups no longer useful) across
                        time and fixed. </p>







                      <p>Fine. So, why is Sociology's network theory so valuable beyond just the network insights gleaned from
                        19th and 20th centuries' network problems? Follow: European sociology came of age in the analog social
                        era, while </strong> North American Sociology only recently come of age (Quebec in the 1960's [post-1968],
                        U.S. in the 1990's[post-1999], in the digital social era. Therefore, the problem-solving patterns
                        of past sociology are inherently small-data and more qualitative analysis, and thus only Sociology
                        incorporates "human-ness" into the billion rows and columns of quantitative--numbers-only--analysis.</p>







                      <p>For example, Oxford-developed S.I.E.N.A. Software accomplishes this task. SIENA--named for Simulation
                        Investigation for Empirical Network Analysis--software calculates the real-time values, direction,
                        and conditions of each relationship (link) in a network, simultaneously as each node, network, or
                        alter-link changes or is changed; with this, it is possible to isolate directional, conditional
                        <i>influence change</i> in real-time. Real-time sounds impossible, however, the SIENA documentation
                        <sup id="9one">2</sup> describes its program algorithm to the statistical analysis of network data, with the focus
                        on social networks. </p>







                      <p>An easy example to grasp this is the concept of whether a person
                        <i>self-selects</i>(e.g., due to subconscious leanings) into a group and thus matches to fruition the
                        group's behavior with little group influence? Or does this same person join a group and emulates
                        the group's behavior, by the group's influence over time. Sociological network analysis, using Snjder's
                        SIENA software, achieves the impossible with the closed, directed graph networks that characterize
                        blockchain technology. The network graph can be here understood as entire (complete) networks (i.e,
                        the blockchain in its entirety without hard forks), not as personal (egocentered) networks: Using
                        this SIENA model allows for the necessary assumptions that a set of nodes (social actors) is given,
                        and all ties (links) between these nodes are known - except perhaps for a moderate amount of missing
                        data</p>







                      <p>If, and only if, this level of analysis may be achieved, the blockchain development may follow a linear,
                        directed path of maturity with social and world needs. Until that time, that Sociology Network Theorists
                        are called upon, blockchain developers will continue to bat their arms in the dark, stumbling over
                        again the same bugs. Sadly, this semi-opaque future implicates the same fate as those that attempt
                        to use blockchain for their currency, contract, and other societal needs--in this case, the blind
                        will indeed lead the blind. </p>

                      <h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">How Can We Best Modularize our App Designs in Order to Achieve the Much Vaunted "Separation of Concerns"?</h6>















                      <p class="firstparagraph">There was once a time for App Developers that our habits followed our inner-philosophers--as an Esteemed
                        Order of Coders--we held ourselves in the highest regard to separate form from function, and style
                        from structural design. Hence, in the early 2000's, a tri-partite, sensible world guided every web
                        coder to abide by The scaffolding of HTML, functionality of JavaScript, and styling of CSS. A decade
                        later, we must throw out this antiquated division of labor within web coding. </p>
                      <p>Library modularization, (think JQuery, JSX, Bootstrap, etc.) within Javascript ES16 reveals that modules
                        and components Must hold together CSS/HTML/JS, part by part. So, if a decade ago three teams handled
                        html, js, css, it is now requisite to divide up 3 teams to 3 components (a team for the carousel
                        widget, a team for the navigation widgets, and
                        <i> each</i> of these component teams
                        <strong>must</strong> be maintained together, not separately, the module's required html, js, css. </p>
                      <p>







                        This means that the new Division of Labour can no longer follow past patterns from 5 years ago. Otherwise, any and all coding
                        will necessarily begin to 'reinvent the wheel.' This is because any module, any library you go to,
                        will
                        <i>already</i> have its HTML pre-configured, JS pre-configured, CSS pre-configured. Thus, attempts to
                        extricate new css from one module to another (or worse yet, sharing css of modules), will only invite
                        eventual misery, almost instantly setting booby traps for the next coders upon arrival.</p>



                      <p>So, where is the creativity? Where is the originality then? It is not gone. It has evolved to a higher
                        level of abstraction, leaving to automation the boring stuff. So, if Vanilla JS is considered malpractice
                        in the modern world, and if ad-hoc JQuery is mocked and scoffed at by React coders, then where is
                        creativity? If yesterday's craft was the hoisting of 15 javascript functions on each page, the New
                        Art of modular coding is akin to a game of Tetris. Part by part, module by module, the modern coder
                        open-source window-browses and window-shops; goes home, and cuts and pastes, and folds and clips,
                        then assembles and hangs to dry. Do Python programmers rewrite each particular module definition?
                        That's absurd. Equally absurd is the javascript programmer that rewrites from scratch their modules.
                        </p>



                      <p>The esteemed Order of JavaScript Coders must wake up, and regain its work-load balance in this new
                        age--an age that each year since 2014, the JavaScript language is rewritten, each year now, in both
                        syntactic sugar and also fundamental structure--especially the importing and exporting of modules.
                        Therefore, philosophical Honor behooves each of us to a higher complexity, and a new commitment to,
                        the "Separation of Concerns." We can allow ourselves a break, thankful for Progress, a progress by
                        which we must
                        <i>Stand on the Shoulders of Giants</i>, and Code-Create! </p>

                      <p class="firstparagraph">Facebook Scandals
                        <sup>1</sup> of recent months have demoralized the leadership for a role of misinformation in the Tech
                        Age, however I charge Mark Zuckerberg's innocence
                        <i>not</i> because all of us, as a society, were equally warned. Rather, arbitrary mathematical forces
                        created abnormal, never-before-seen network structural density and symmetry patterns. Technological
                        shifts were so efficient at multiplying and exacerbating misinformation because a curious sociological
                        network phenomenon rendered parts of our daily social learning and acculturating process to network
                        forces out of our own control.
                      </p>







                      <p>A January 2016 American Sociology Association Newsletter Editorial
                        <sup> 2</sup> from Sally T. Hillsman, in which she explained how the social mechanisms of our own misinformation
                        were not entirely within our own control to resist. In fact, the arbitrary (often random) social
                        structural changes from higher social-media hours, create an arbitrary social network structure whose
                        links (in their content and influence) begin to dominate over nodes (each of us). In other words,
                        the sway of trends and opinionated critical thought becomes dominated by the relationships, e.g.,
                        the "likes" and "shares", leading to a statistically natural propensity toward homogeneity--a.k.a.
                        group-think. The mechanism is akin to peacefully swimming close and parallel to the coastline, and
                        (due to random coastal floor structure), a rip-tide suddenly ships you far out to sea--a fatal and
                        tragic fate rendering experienced swimmers out of their own control. Same principle with an arbitrary
                        <i>underlying and unseen</i> network structure.</p>
                      <p>Our social network structures always are prone to continual shift, and so the usual "interruptions"
                        that previously stopped this inward shift soon began to disappear. Hillsman explains: </p>







                      <p class="quote">Lies, half-truths, and misinformation spread so rapidly across the public through digital communication
                        that the timespan for thoughtful, effective correction or rebuttal is infinitesimal. Because of confirmation
                        Bias, misinformation and outright lies quickly strengthen preconceived truths or pre-held beliefs
                        that are already hard to change. </p>

                      <p>Therefore, even though we all have been pointedly warned,
                        <i> none of us</i> without advanced sociological analysis skills could understand that a curious network
                        phenomonenon--ultimately driven by some arbitrary mathematical calculation involving size, density,
                        symmetry, conditional influences, and the strength of ties outweighing network nodes. For the reasons
                        of these factors, our social inclinations were
                        <i>out of our control</i> -- no, but really, this time they were! </p>

                      <p>And so, we can learn from Sociology what steps to take in order to counteract random, but risky, network
                        phenomena -- because nobody likes to go for a swim at the beach, and unwittingly get shipped out
                        to sea!

                      <p class="firstparagraph">Other than college pre-med students, few know the MCAT exam--the gatekeeper of U.S. &amp; Canadian
                        Medical Schools--underwent a major modification in 2015
                        <sup>2</sup>. Much deeper than Biological and Technological updates, major sections were added and/or
                        expanded including the Social, Pyschological and Biological foundations of
                        <i>behavior</i>. Named the
                        <i>Health Systems Science</i>
                        <sup>3</sup>, the American Medical Association's modern, holistic approach articulates outcomes-based
                        measures for healthy living and disease prevention efforts. You could say the AMA is indeed,
                        <i>woke</i>. </p>
                      <p>But really, what's the difference and why would we care? And, who doesn't know that an apple-a-day
                        keeps the doctor away? Dr. Jeffrey Borkan, MD, PHD of Brown University's Warren Alpert Medical School,
                        explains the evident role of all those unnoticed social interactions involved in obtaining and consuming
                        that apple. Further, the spatial and economic
                        <i>availability</i> of that apple also plays a role in keeping the doctor away. Borkan explains:

                        but also the community and the population

                        school shooting, we as an American society have not become 'numb' to these events. It hurts as much
                        as it did in 1999.</p>
                      <p> Darn that innocuous Spring day in 1999, when we heard the most absurd news-- students attacked their
                        own colleagues at Colombine? In my blog post from January 10, I wrote that American Sociology, along
                        with Qu&eacute;bec, came of age much later than European Sociology. The past 50 years' social changes
                        and new problems are generally atrributed for the increasing demand for sociological expertise after
                        1999, after a singular, senseless tragedy of a school shooting--this event, like a small kernel of
                        societal desperation for a solution--led to a flurry of self-professed sociologists &agrave; la Michael
                        Moore's Colombine, and other social-responsibility themed social consciousness. So far, only mutually
                        incompatible solutions. The problem, however, is not new, only the manifestation of it.</p>

                        <i>Anomie</i>, coined by Emile Durkheim in the late 1800's, captured the sense of instability, cultural
                        and moral relativism that undermined a shared sense of meaning. Suicides, week-after-week, month-after-month?
                        In 1897 France, noone had ever seen it before--at such rates--and people wanted answers. Alas, a
                        kernel of social desperation leading to inquiry.</p>

                        smiling on this roller coaster through another, yet not altogether new, technological thrill-ride.

                      </h6>



                      <p class="firstparagraph">Has anyone else been underwhelmed by the lack of Bitcoin's daily
                        <i>presence</i>, despite its everpresence at the dinner tables and caf&eacute;s across America. Sure,
                        it's more of a "metropolitan" phenomenon; and sure, it's become an accepted global platform--along
                        with myriad other crypto-currencies, but it's exchange-worthiness remains shrowded, and misunderstood
                        by many. Cryptocurrencies are useful as a vehicle for investment, and yes, there are Bitcoin millionaires
                        due to the currency's rise to fame with last year's increase in value (from $1,000 to ~$20,000) etc.,
                        etc. But, so far its contributions, uses, fame are one-sidedly
                        <i>macro-</i>economic. A recent CNET article
                        <sup>1</sup>, among others, documents miniscule (and not improving) percentage of
                        <i>actual</i> use at the "cash-registers" of society.</p>







                      <p>Is there something wrong with such little micro-economic usage? Not at all! According to general sociological
                        <i>Early Adopter</i> theory--based on Everett M. Roger's Diffusion of Innovations
                        <sup>2</sup>--the timeline of the Innovation Adoption Lifecycle is fairly ordinary. That is, the Roger's
                        bell curve ranges from the beginning innovators, to early adopters, early majority, and late majority.
                        However, the blockchain articles always miss the point. Currencies are more of a distraction compared
                        to the genuine usefulness for the every-person, in every-day affairs, on a given day--i.e., micro-economic
                        use.</p>







                      <p>The true value, the kind that makes our lives easier on any given day, and for the every-person, is
                        <i>not</i> the currency, it is the contract, that allows for individualized, targeted sharing of specific
                        information--whether financial, governmental, or any other centralized database. An example is in
                        order before I continue, since we can all relate to the risk of using a credit or debit card, the
                        risk most notably concerning Target store credit card hacks a couple years ago. </p>
                      <p>Suppose a person shops at 3 different retailers, using a different credit card for each. For these
                        3 transactions, this person had only needed to provide two discrete pieces of information about themselves
                        for each transaction: they prove they have the $27, $200, and $5; and they prove a third party(i.e.,CC
                        or bank)will make that $27, $200, or $5 available, if their client agrees. Instead, for each transaction,
                        they open their
                        <i>entire</i> financial information, and can only hope that law-enforcement will prevent cyber-theft;
                        and if the store's databases are hacked, then tough-luck! </p>
                      <p>Crypto-contracts provide the technology for this individualized, risk-free transaction, rather than
                        for each transaction, providing the generalized information for individual transaction. Highly inefficient!
                        Nobody thinks to walk around with their life-savings in cash, then at the 7-11 store, to open their
                        wad of cash and peel out a bill. The credit card system, blessed as it is, did not previously have
                        technology to avoid this very thing. So, financial institutions have had to rely on the many layers
                        of security, passwords, pins, mothers' maiden names, etc. Then, based on the mathematics behind prime
                        numbers, they hope to keep your money safe in one, centralized spot--with a bright red target on
                        it. </p>
                      <p>Now, the crypto-contract provides this decidedly *micro-economic* experience for the everyday person.
                        And that, my friends, has nothing to do with crypto-currencies. There is no micro-economic value
                        in crypto-currency, instead the crypto-
                        <i>contract</i> is the true, unsung hero, and a hero we will all get to know. [personal opinion - this
                        hero's name is the Ethereum Virtual Machine]. In any case, Crypto-contracts provide this ability
                        to provide pinpointed,
                        <i>specific, targeted information</i> as citizens, too. When we provide our drivers license number,
                        for the sake of renting that car, we provide every aspect of information of ourselves to Hertz. They
                        don't need this. They need to know only and exclusively driving-record related details--not the entire
                        governmental database of information about you!

                      <h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle"> Tech on the Regret: Unintended, secondary effects of communication- and activity-based app-designs
                        </h6>



























                      <p class="firstparagraph">Given that our app-use is inextricably tied up with our own behavior, activity/communication-based
                        app developers have in the past year accepted (mostly in word) a renewed responsibility. More like
                        resposibility for a multi-faceted power of influence granted to an industry, suddenly, disproportionately
                        great, and
                        <i>semi-arbitrarily related</i> to the designer's intent (and control!). After all, if the Saintly Mark
                        Zuckerberg's activity/communication-based app inadvertantly led to novel, and deeply consequential,
                        effects, then anyone could. </p>
                      <p>After all, who could guess
                        <i>how</i> these app-design effects would affect the users, years later. Who do we think programmers
                        are, sociologists? More specifically, who could know
                        <i>which</i> mundane coding practices, arbitrary app-design--like sharing permissions/features? Sure,
                        everyone deep down knew their company practices yield unfathomable power of influence over the daily
                        habits of cell-users, a.k.a. everyone. The easy part is knowing; the hard part is learning how and
                        why certain app-features lead to behavioral risks.</p>
                      <p>There could be no better example than the Alcoholic faced with an intervention by a loving family longing
                        for change. The alcoholic could be forgiven for past misdeeds, but without actual
                        <i>Acknowledgement</i> of a crisis in direction, which necessitates professional help from social scientists.
                        Therefore, the recent
                        <i>acknowledgments</i> signify something deeper--they signify a humility that app-designers are not
                        sociologists, generally speaking. So, that means hiring sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists
                        for every N
                        <small>th</small> app-coder and software engineer. History can't be rewritten, but it can be interpreted
                        and learned from. The acknowledgment is itself a victory if it induces learning from the raw, social
                        sciences, whose expertise
                        <i>can</i> predict how or why certain "life"-features, practices, and policies often unfold with undue
                        and unintended social consequences. </p>















                      <p>Water under the bridge, but going forward, it is one thing to claim a "renewed sense of remorse", another
                        to acknowledge, learn and change. Like last November
                        <sup>1</sup> when Facebook co-founder Sean Parker confessed certain designs like "social-validation feedback
                        loop" and other app-design intentions, while ignoring potential secondary effects on society. So,
                        the
                        <i>Acknowledgment</i> is the big win here--not so much the remorse!

                      </h6>



                      <p class="firstparagraph">7 Ethereum-based technological features offer us a new world -- a decentralized new world, not dependent
                        on the centralized servers of Instagram, Comcast, T-Mobile, Amazon, etc. With that statement ends
                        general consensus among blockchain experts, pundits, and authors. However, if the current logistical
                        obstacles provide controversy and competing algorithms over sustainability, security, and scalability,
                        then they reveal much more about the general pathway of social uses (and potential effects) than
                        they hide. In my February 15th
                        <a href="#18-02-15">blog</a>, I touched on a few features of micro-economic uses so as to distinguish the more certain
                        aspects of the crypto-contract horizon.</p>



                      <p>
                        <strong>Prologue</strong>



                      </p>



                      <p>So, what are some core features of block-chain technology that affect the quality of our lives, and
                        the
                        <i>productivity</i> of our work as a society of academics, public-sector and private-sector professionals?
                        First, a little background and context before I outline seven blockchain functionalities. The Ethereum
                        blockchain helps distinguish itself--and its blockchain-native language Solidity--from earlier tech,
                        like Bitcoin and other Proof of Work-based blockchains. Ethereum blockchain offers a syntax and programming
                        features, e.g. "looping", "recursion", with the full power of a
                        <i>Turing Complete</i> language--that is, given enough resources, the language can solve any programmable
                        problem. </p>







                      <p>More background and a clarifying metaphor are in order: The Bitcoin blockchain transaction resembles
                        the accounting system of a foos-ball table point rack with a basic calculator glued to the side.
                        In contradistinction, An Ethereum blockchain transaction would resemble a network of computers,
                        <i>which is itself,</i> a computer--hence, the name Ethereum Virtual Machine. This allows for Quickbooks
                        to calculate into a PDF to be sent via an email contract-signing program. Much more useful!</p>







                      <p>Therefore, Ethereum's Blockchain is more than a networked, chained list of blocks, like Bitcoin. The
                        Ethereum blockchain is actually a "Virtual Machine", like a a big networked "home computer". The
                        native language of the blockchain, Solidity, allows for an
                        <i>application binary interface</i>, ABI. So, for example, I can type up an Ethereum contract on my
                        home computer, then directly access by command line the blockchain itself. In layman's terms, the
                        manner that modern-day app, for example Instagram, is a centralized API (Application Programming
                        Interface) that allows one programming system to interact with another, such as Instragram offers
                        a "sharing API" that connects to hardware contacts, thus facitilating communicating with third-party
                        aplications, like sharing your instagram picture to your Facebook account, via your T-Mobile phone's
                        contacts list. This API relationship broadly describes the modern world we live in, wherein a Chryser
                        driving system exchanges API information with your T-Mobile Bluetooth network system, which exchanges
                        API information with your own contact list, and so on, and our lives are made easier. </p>







                      <p>So, are we out of the woods? Has Ethereum solved the blockchain question? Yes, if it were the 1920
                        pre-relativity days; However, with the advent of quantum computing, potential security vulnerabilities
                        immediately arise. The reason being that digital math uses binary "on/off" calculations, while quantum
                        math implicates a tertiary,
                        <i>qubit</i> "simultaneous states". Therefore, we have now entered the 3rd generation of blockchain
                        technology, both programmable, but also quantum-proof due to mathematical graph features. For example,
                        IOTA's blockchain design utilizes a
                        <i>Winternitz One-Time Signature</i>, by which one's transaction is entered into with a private-key,
                        and the blockchain moreso resembles a "Tangle" of a directed graph, which allows for computational
                        "states". IOTA recently garnered criticism in January 2018 due to an unfortunate crypto-hack, that
                        exposed an apparent vulnerability. In truth, this was a case of user-error because users were
                        <i>re-using</i> their one-time keys, which significantly decreases security to the point that a home
                        computer could crack the code! I choose to not digress further, and quantum computing is not quite
                        advanced enough now to cause damage, but in the future could potentially split the blockchain in
                        two, or other quantum possibilities.



                      </p>



                      </p>



                      <p>In sum, the technical obstacles change each month, however one must not lose sight of the forest for

                      <p class="firstparagraph">



                        The guiding light through the centuries of scientific paradigms, in the Kuhnian sense
                        <sup id="19-1">1</sup>, have derived from deductive ideas from above - whether priestly or royal decree. Then, the
                        primacy of the
                        <i>Scientific Method</i> from the Renaissance forward--punctuated first by Copernican Heliocentrism,
                        then other Paradigm Shifts--has directed rational and ethical norms in each respective period, e.g.
                        Enlightenment authors of 17th, 18th century. Fast forward to the modern period, wherein the current
                        era's emerging paradigm holds Sharing as a collective-priority and responsibility, then an amazing
                        philosophical moment.
                        <i>Historical Materialism</i>
                        <sup>2</sup> prescribes what is directly here a novel Paradigm Shift by which authority is not derived
                        from governmental, financial sources, but rather the
                        <i>shared</i>societal consensus about cryptographic, mathematical proofs as true authority. Further,
                        the revolutionary shift also innately provides tools for implemention through decentralized, programmable
                        data-sharing. Cryptography has in a sense become a
                        <i>de jure</i> middle-person for identification and verification of property. </p>







                      <p>



                        <strong>I. Protecting rights through immutable records</strong>
                        <br />Inalieable Rights can now be identified and verified by the cryptographic authority of a mathematical
                        proof, rather than exclusively through governmental or financial institutions from above. The modern
                        period also has held this decentralized, individual authority as the
                        <i>a priori</i> starting points for philosophical proofs. Premises about truth begin with the conditions
                        of humankind, not idealogies. In fact, it was the
                        <i>Young Hegelians</i> of early 19th century Vienna &amp; Berlin, who ushered in the Modern Era of Western
                        Philosophy, by laying out Truth as inverted, beginning from the empirical "ground" upward. This "upside-down
                        tree" defines philosophical modernity. Jean-Paul Sartre wrote that the whole of
                        <i>Existentialism</i> and 20th century philsophy is a mere subset, and never escapes Continental Materialism,
                        as argued in Sartre's
                        <i>Search for a Method</i>.
                        <sup>3</sup>
                      </p>



                      <p>All of the Sciences, prodded by this Truth of Empiricism, followed suit through all the tech innovations
                        since Hegel. I'm so surprised by this, because for me, the role of cryptography is shocking on two
                        levels. First, cryptography resemblees philosophy rather than the Empiricism that I had envisioned
                        would govern social rule (Some once thought nuclear sciences held this role--no longer! Mathematics
                        takes the crown. Secondly, I'm still dumbfounded that a Paradigm Shift
                        <i>first</i> offers the tools to fulfill itself? Staggering to consider the arbitrary changes ahead
                        for a society that is provided the tools of social structural change first, but how quite convenient!



                      </p>







                      <p>
                        <strong>II. Bureaucratic Atomization in a True Sharing Economy</strong>
                      </p>



                      <p>It is satisfyingly reassuring to see the good-natured, altruistic efforts among the thousands, upon
                        thousands of open-source volunteers, and blockchain innovators, like Vitalik Buterin author of Ethereum
                        Virtual Machine, whose aims and efforts make staggering progress each quarter. The potential for
                        removing the "middle-person" from the day-to-day, micro-economic "cost of living". This goes for
                        for the exchanging of titles, legal documents, etc. </p>
                      <p>Sharing of Resources is, in my personal opinion, critical to global future--both out of increasing
                        necessity in allocating increasingly limited resources; an arbitrary rearrangement of
                        <i>Social Structure</i> and distribution of its resources. While the exponential population growth looms
                        on the near horizon, a clear, pre-existing solution begins with a focus on
                        <i>smart</i>, effective sharing of resources. The driving principle of sustainability is made convenient
                        by means of blockchain technology, extending for example to local economies, cooperatives, ride-sharing,
                        etc. </p>

                        <strong>III. Removing Double-Dipping from International Remittances </strong>



                      </p>



                      <p>
                        <i>"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to
                          take away."



                        </i>



                        <br /> --Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, 1939</p>



                      <p>







                        Taxes and tariffs are difficult enough, the double-dipping of the current international remittance system, &aacute; la Western
                        Union, does not reflect the global, sharing Economy of 2018. The existing remittance system (not
                        speaking to
                        <i>centralized</i>, middle-man alternatives like PayPay, etc.)--supposing if I wire $2 Loonie to a Canadian
                        friend's Canadian Bank--requires payments executed through two separate bank transactions in two
                        national payments systems, thus the sending country and receiving country each take a cut. Like everything
                        else--c'est la vie. Or is it? The beauty of Ethereum is that it "talks" well with others and across
                        borders, while Bitcoin remains of little use for micro-transactions that involve semi-basic calculations.
                        The reason being that Bitcoin blockchain language, Script, cannot support loops (while statements,
                        etc.) </p>
                      <p>Currently, both EOS and Ethereum blockchains appear poised for the most financial-friendly blockchain
                        tech.

                      <p class="firstparagraph">I feel that data is one of the more underestimated new commodities of the age. Most visualize data
                        as rows and columns, and at most only non-conditional dynamic data. Data are not so mute! Data, in
                        most object-oriented languages at least, represents
                        <i>functions</i>, conditions, and predicted values. And so, our own behavior, coupled with our networks'
                        behavior, coupled with predictive analytics--this represents a wealth of information beyond our attributed
                        or inherited traits. The programming is
                        <i>in</i> the data, however, citizens have become less and less involved, ceding app by centralized
                        app our own information and ensuring profit to 3rd party marketers. The centralized nature of the
                        internet allows for this, while the new landscape of
                        <i>decentralized applications</i> (DAPP) completely upends this structure of the status quo.

                        and returned to the individual's control, and
                        <i>profit</i>. As sure as the 19th century's "labor-hour" became commodified to a calculable asset,
                        i.e. property, which
                        <i>another</i> party controls and makes profit; And as sure as the 20th century's data analytics became
                        commodified into calculable assets for another party to take control and make profit; then only now
                        in this 21st century does technology offer a new, more egalitarian path.

                      </p>



                      <p class="quote">



                        According to Greek Mythology, the days of eery, noticeable lack of storms have never been interpreted as a period of grace.
                        Moreso,
                        <i>Halcyon</i> tranquility only means a temporary moratorium on the winds and waves, imposed by Aeolus,
                        God of Wind, to protect the nesting eggs of Alcyone, his daughter. </p>



                      <p> If blockchain tech changes how we do research, analysis, and forecasting, as much as it changes international,
                        and cross-industry transactions, then are we faced with a similar dilemma as the "novelty", and double-dealing,
                        of multi-nationals of the 1990s? No, because blockchain renders organizations, even those with a
                        spotty past, into transparent, democratic, efficient, secure and easily scrutinized.



                      </p>



                      <p>



                        After all, without transparent proof, how else would I know my bananas are the "pura vida" Costa Rique&ntilde; ones? More
                        importantly, what was the carbon footprint of that banana's journey from its native soil to my breakfast
                        table? New blockchain companies like
                        <a href="https://www.provenance.org/">Provenance.org</a>,
                        <a href="http://www.skuchain.com/" target="_blank">skuchain</a>,
                        <a href="http://www.blockverify.io/">http://www.blockverify.io/</a> are a few noticeable game-changers. So, for bananas not backed by
                        mathematical proofs, I really have to ask myself, is it
                        <i>really</i> an authentic Fair Trade banana? </p>







                      <p>Transactions are hardly valuable in the products themselves, if removed from the value of the
                        <i>transaction per se</i>. International supply chain transactions, by virtue of a recently possible
                        decentralized, permanent record and monitoring, have begun to make inroads in agriculture, petroleum,
                        pharmaceuticals, food-supply and other multi-stage industries. </p>







                      <p>If corporate and governmental transactions are to be made public--many bearing enterprise or State
                        secrets, then will forecasting also go the way of birds? Possibly. Online platforms like Augur

                        markets speculation and so forth. Armed with vast, transparent knowledge, the everyday person can
                        now access the whims and power of Aeolus, and forecasting the winds of Fortune.</p>

                      <h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Facebook-Friendly Third-Generation Data Structures</h6>







                      <p class="firstparagraph">Today, I'm going to write about data structures, and challenges that face Vitalik Buterin and other
                        blockchain architects. ' Now, why in the
                        <i>world</i> would I or anyone else care about ooh, merge sorts, bubble sorts, classificatory trees,
                        and the advent of a third form of data structure? </p>



                      <p>Today, we live in an ever more relational world. With all our technology, we just can't wait to hear
                        the latest gossip about sister Becky's Boyfriend's Brother's Friend that
                        <i>also</i> got to meet Shakira. Gossip to one person is a valuable asset to the data analyst. Because,
                        how else could an algorithm draw simultaneous conclusions about two friends that "liked" the same
                        Samsung VR, and that they are both located near Best Buy. Thanks to classificatorial wisdom of AI
                        &amp; plain machine-learning? </p>



                      <p>These relational queries are simply too difficult for relational, row & column SQL data structures.
                        In fact, many queries are impossible, due to unprescient database schema architectures. Next, with
                        the need to "objectify" data into non-relational objects, rather than an antiquated, rigid row-and-column
                        design. Thus, the second major type of data structure is more flexible and adept in finding these
                        relational queries that are ever more in vogue. However, the crystal-like, pristine non-relational,
                        No-SQL designs quickly turn to spaghetti, and are poor for scalability. Between a rock and a hard
                        place, a third data structure has emerged in recent years.</p>
                      <p>



                        Graph Data Structures
                        <sup>2</sup> allow data queries that had otherwise been impossible to capture in an entity relationship
                        diagram. The ideal example to clarify is the manner that the Swiss banks' accounts were discovered
                        to be hiding vast amounts of hidden taxes, etc. The cover-up was so well-constructed that not until
                        new, graph database queries discovered patterns of money flow
                        <sup>1</sup>:

                      <p class="quote">



                        The data was then turned into a graph format to detect then fine-tune the connections between the nodes. The Swiss Leak held
                        around 60,000 files that contained information about over 100,000 clients in 203 countries, which
                        means that the resulting graph database had more than 275,000 nodes with 400,000 relationships among
                        them.

                      <p class="quote">



                        By being able to easily visualise the networks around clients and accounts, the reporters found many more connections than
                        they had before, which lead to the Swiss Leaks revelations soon being shared with the public and
                        regulators across the globe.







                      </p>



                      <p>And you thought that plagiarism-detecting software was impressive for complexity! The beauty of this
                        newly available software (even Microsoft jumped on board in recent years) means that sociologists,
                        economists can begin to make better headway in the way that our many interactions become more complex
                        with more data. Remember, in the past ten minutes, more data information was just produced than most
                        of human history! Thus, new and upcoming needs in domains like content management &amp; access control,
                        geo-routing (public transportation), gene sequencing, bio-informatics, and so on. So, as technology
                        takes us forward, and we make our considerations, let's stick by the golden rules of parallel processing,
                        scalability, and, now, graph-network mindedness for the new data structures, and schema, of the Era!

                      <h6 class="chapternumber dailytitle">Languages</h6>







                      <p class="firstparagraph">While I've had blockchain-related topics on the mind lately, it seems I can't escape it as I broach
                        new fields--blockchain is everywhere! Well, I had begun my blog with intentions about the accelerated
                        speed of language and syntax formation, and the curious phenomenon I'd call, for lack of a better
                        word or or my own reading, "declarative-syntax-merging". This involves the curious, and largely unknown,
                        growth of JavaScript scripting language into almost every domain of web apps, data analysis, and
                        even the bounds of
                        <i>Logic</i> itself. Though I won't submit my readers to a history of a language, suffice it to say
                        that, "If a certain algorithm, device, or object is programmable, then it will eventually be programmed
                        in JavaScript."



                      </p>



                      <p>Without getting into technicals, I'll instead use a perfect metaphor--the manner by which English merged
                        with French, beginning with the conquests of William of Normandy, around 1096 onward. Almost a thousand
                        years later, we can see how English grammar inherited it's Anglo-Saxon Linguistic roots, along with
                        the core vocabulary; Then, as English vocabulary moves past the first few thousand core words, e.g.
                        "milk" or "house" from "melche" or "haus", then more than 70% of English Vocabulary is directly inherited
                        from French, e.g. "lactose" or "mansion" from "lait" or "maison".</p>



                      <p>Similarly, the language of the web and original browsers, JavaScript, has similarly morphed into a
                        new language called Solidity, but in only a micro-fraction of English's time. The usual FOMO logic
                        propels coding language use, for example FOMO induced Microsoft's flagship Text Editor, Visual Code,
                        to adopt it years ago
                        <sup id="22-1">1</sup>. The language of Ethereum Blockchain is Solidity, which like the above example, has two parents,
                        one non-legitimate. It is in all respects totally JavaScript, yet with object-oriented elements of
                        C++. For the layperson, let's just say Solidity resembles a "Liger", in it is at it's core JavaScript,
                        yet with increasing sophistication based on C++ logic, its head and torso has begun to resemble the
                        powerful machine-code of C++ ever more. And it is a beautiful, but curious phenomonenon.

                      <p class="firstparagraph">1.4 million
                        <i>new</i> jobs by 2020; End over end, year after year, the computer programming industry continues
                        to add another 20% more jobs each year, for the next five years. This is the only field that demand
                        outstrips the supply--and increasingly short supply. So much so, the US Department of Labor forecasts
                        U.S. citizens will be able to fill 39% of those positions; there are not enough Immigration visas
                        (especially in the Trumpian era of isolationism) to make up the rest. </p>



                      <p>



                      </p>



                      <p>So, how is it that only 14% of females in the entire field of cybersecurity? Silicon Valley is, at
                        its best, obscenely one-sided. At Google, only 17% of the company's tech jobs are filled by women.
                        Facebook women staff only 15% of tech jobs, and Twitter? 10% female. The figures on women in computer
                        science across the nation, across the entire industry are not improving, but
                        <i>declining</i>?
                        <sup>1</sup>



                      </p>



                      <p>Of course, we've heard these statistics from any given headline, and in the halls across the university
                        landscape, starting with Women in STEM (Science, Tech, Engineering, Mathematics) programs
                        <sup>3</sup>. Yet, why, with so much money, so many programs, so many non-governmental, non-profit effort?



                      </p>



                      <p>I argue that tech
                        <i>culture</i> is directly to blame. Who then? Not a person, but principles are to blame. Culture--often
                        defined as shared beliefs, norms, language and behaviors--can hardly be changed, but it can be understood.
                        Firstly, there are two kinds: organizational climate versus culture



                        <br />There is a book, called "Program or be Programmed
                        <sup id="24-3">3</3>
                      </p>, by which the author explains social consequences of a dichotomized society--between those that manipulate
                      the environment around them, whether automating tasks at work, or simply fixing a simple software bug,
                      by adding a comma. This literacy of the Current Era is akin to the 26-letter alphabet of written sentences
                      and paragraphs, and--not to be taken for granted--is the exclusive form of communication, outside of
                      a 100-foot perimeter, up until 150 years ago. Knowledge is not power, the communication of knowledge
                      is power.</p>



                      <p>I argue that today, the power is to program one application programming interface (API) to talk to
                        another API. In other words, the ability to directly communicate with software at the command-line
                        is not now a requisite skill, but promotions would not escape this necessity! So, now reverting back
                        to the subject of women in tech, American leadership is in deep peril without more female insight.
                        I will finish by citing that Ares, the violent, untamed Greek
                        <i>god of war</i>, cannot always drive the Capitalist engine; because She, Athena, the
                        <i>goddess of intelligence</i> represents true strategy!

                        While coding up a better shell for this website, I thought it's remarkable how our lives get easier and easier with each
                        passing year of tech. Using JavaScript--the primordial web-coding language--I marvel at the convenience
                        of delegating mundande coding stuff to taskrunners, like
                        <i>Gulp</i>--a programmable package manager that "bundles" up the libraries to be used in the app. It
                        is truly a joy! </p>



                      <p>I write four styling
                        <i>functions</i>, with about 16
                        <i>variables</i> and voil&agrave;! I finish in 3 hours what would have taken me 15 hours, then another
                        5 hours a month for upkeep. Instead, now, it's as though I wind up the clock, and need only periodically
                        check, and perhaps update a variable or two ... Technology. I'm gushing for joy.</p>



                      <p> This was mere JavaScript--with a truly
                        <i>Turing Complete</i>--pan-algorithm status--languages, the possibilities are 100-fold with Python
                        language library collection; this library collection includes NASA modules, mathematical proofs,
                        and limitless uses from web-scraping for unstructured data to an excellent data visualization collection.
                        Sometimes I feel like I'm in the Library of Congress, and better yet because, PIP, the Python package
                        manager acts and automates like a cyborg librarian, for lack of better imagery. </p>



                      <p>I just have so much joy watching a project come to life, and it's even a greater delight if this project
                        comes to life and stays alive, through the joys of automation!

                      <p class="firstparagraph">







                        I must confess that on the very day that Our Daily Tech Blog gets an under-the-head make-over for security's sake, I wrote
                        the new formatting file right over today's post. Amazing, and the two occurred nearly simultaneously
                        as I worked on them, their paths crossed and poof, gone! Same platform, and I paid the price! Whether
                        I change my ways is yet to be seen, but I shall continue with my original theme for the day, namely,
                        Sustainability, a.k.a. Carbon Footprint.</p>

                      <p class="quote">Power consumption is one of the major costs of bitcoin mining, as dedicated machines crunch the algorithms
                        that build a record of every single bitcoin transaction and are rewarded with tiny fractions of a
                        bitcoin for their efforts.
                        <sup id="explain">1</sup>

                      </p>

                      <p> Today I have a mild Critique and Praise for the blockchain sustainability problem caused by sky-high
                        electricity bills! Computer algorithms do waste electricity, not like your Widescreen. More electricity
                        is gobbled up by small and large mining operations in nearly every country than small nations!
                        <sup id="electricity">1</sup>. Ethereum, Bitcoin and a handful of other "Proof-of-Work" designs require electricity because
                        the investment in equipment itself is investment, but more importantly, two-way incentivation for
                        mining drives the system, and the scarcity demand through difficulty computations. </p>



                      <p>So, is the electricity consumption really
                        <i>correlated</i> with the value, scarcity, of the currency? Yes. Digiconomist--a cryptocurrency analysis
                        site
                        <sup id="digiconomist">3</sup> estimates
                        <i>each</i>Ethereum transaction represents a 45 Kilowatt-hour of electricity's mining. (A visa credit
                        card transaction is 0.00651 kWh. The entire Ethereum global blockchain could be "using as much as
                        4.2 Terawatt-hours (tWh), or slightly more than the country of Cyprus
                        <sup id="cyprus">1</sup>." So, electricity comparisons are telling, but how does this relate to its environment impact,
                        sustainability itself?</p>

                      <p>Carbon Footprint, our energy consumption index, can be compared to another element of scarcity, which
                        dictates fluctuations in value: Gold. According to
                        <i>Digiconomist</i>, an average household's Carbon Footprint is about 10 tons of CO2 per year. The article
                        does the math for us very succinctly: </p>

                      <p class="quote">On top of this, we can find that the process of mining Bitcoin isn’t just more energy-intensive, but
                        also has a bigger environmental impact. To reach that conclusion, we first need to estimate the carbon
                        footprint for both. For Bitcoin we can, again, get this number from the Bitcoin Energy Consumption
                        Index. For gold, we assume a carbon footprint of 20 tons of CO2e per every kilogram of gold mined
                        <sup id="digiconomist2">3</sup>.

                      </p>

                      <p>The article continues to clarify that 33,000 kilograms of CO2 per unit mines (comparatively, one Bitcoin's
                        worth of Gold is 4,000 kilograms of CO2). At the end of the day, the electricity costs--if not sustainable
                        long-term--could spell trouble. Hence, the three S's, mentioned last, sustainability is perhaps a
                        larger issue than blockchain Security and Scalability challenges. Again, this is a problem that the
                        third largest cryptocurrency does not have:
                        <i>Ripple</i>, which does not bear a carbon footprint

                      <p class="firstparagraph">In my reflections about environment sustainability issues, I confess I'm sort of a hypocrite ... The
                        whole matter that caused my own introspection begins with my usual daily vexation: Tangles of wires!
                        <br /> &nbsp; ... I've been having electricity issues, here as of late ...</p>

                      <p>

                        On one side, my tiny Yoga Ultrabook usually likes to charge just fine with my phone charger--if I'm stuck without my charger.
                        And due to an untimely end to the charger, I needed a replacement. So, singular errand of the day
                        was a trip to Best Buy to peruse for a 45-Watt USB-C charger ( the new oval charging port on Samsung
                        8's, LG G6's and newer Apple products).
                        <p>Meanwhile, my credit-card sized Raspberry Pi computer runs on an old-school USB charger--a whole
                          Linux Server Tower on a cell-phone charger. Then, we have my trusty Dell (actual) Tower with 16
                          Gigs of RAM, 2-terabytes, etc. that also seems to need an extra fan to stay cool--probably the
                          sustainability of 100 Raspberry computers. My entire carbon footprint changes more with the electrical
                          products that I use, than my vehicle! Well, I also confess my Jeep Cherokee can't even boast 20
                          miles per hour ... oops, conscience pangs, ouch ... Well, hypocritical, slightly, but found not
                          guilty since I'm a bike-commuter for life!</p>

                      <p class="firstparagraph">Environmental Sustainability, again, and a higher-level view of the dilemmea...I couldn't resist:
                        <br /> Bitcoin's Initial Coin Offering was 2011 or so, then Ethereum, with Ether for currency was 2015;
                        These two, ever so prescient designs, also have their Achilles Heal. These two are
                        <strong>"Proof of Work" currency algorithsms</strong>. This means that the "Demand" side of supply-and-demand,
                        derives from
                        <i>difficulty levels</i> of crypto-blocks to mine. So, miners are incentivized to spend $1500 on a semi-mediocre-good
                        mining rig (which is basically 20 NVIDIA Graphics Cards tied together to stack of two-by-fours with
                        lots of fans ... erhem, sustainability?...</p>
                      <p>And for each block that is "solved", hence the block being validated, and somebody's cryptocurrency
                        purchase/transaction is resolved! (takes about 12 minutes for the whole global blockchain to cycle,
                        and Ethereum is less than a minute). So, the whole cycle continues, churning through coal- and carbon-stained
                        hands of the electricity fed to these crypto-mining rigs
                        <sup>1</sup>. For many it's a hobby, like the British Hobbyists' love for ham- and short-wave radio setups,
                        yet this profitable, yet particular hobby resembles the 1870's coal factory smoke stacks in South
                        London!
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Let's face it, if Ethereum is able to successfully hard-fork to a Proof-of-Stake system soon--and Vitalik Buterin and his
                        crew assure us it is coming
                        <sup>2</sup>--then great--problem solved, everything eventually converts to Ethereum. If
                        <i>not</i>they face an existential threat. Because, in a more enlightened ten years from now, those
                        mining depots
                        <i>would</i> look like unfettered factory smoke-stacks. Proof-of-Stack, whose currency value is not
