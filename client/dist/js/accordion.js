     <p class="firstparagraph">Dialectical Materialism<br />I construct my philosophical guidance from a post-Hegelian, Historical-Materialist Philosophy that sees improvement by each iteration of problem-solving. My personal philosophy holds that right actions and true knowledge begin with a final, teleological goal in sight, i.e., the <i>improvement of the Human condition</i>. <br />Post-Hegelian Logic determines a set, then compares the practical <i>thesis</i> of present empirical, perceived conditions against the ideal <i>antithesis</i> toward higher ethical, rational solutions, in order to achieve an improved synthesis, to again be repeated as a new thesis.</p>
    <p class="firstparagraph">Sharing<br />    
    Given that assumptions about population growth and climate change are true (I believe both are true), then global population well-being is threatened earlier than expected. Therefore, my antithesis holds that  smart, effective <i>Sharing of Burden</i>, Sharing of Power, and <i>Sharing of Resources</i> is critical to meeting the imminent challenges of the two said assumptions.  
    </p>
    <p class="firstparagraph">Diversity and Equality<br />
    Workplace culture too often abides by the ethos of "work harder, not smarter." Non-diverse workplaces lack the full set of problem-solving tools that are necessary in a complex, diverse world. 
    </p>
    <p>A better workforce integration along gender, racial, and socio-economic lines is a more heterogeneous workforce: more agile, creative, and efficiently team-oriented workforce--in short, a smarter workforce.
